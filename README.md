# Photoshop Style Guide
My Style Guide starter file I use when I start a Photoshop project.
It is currently using artboards to separate the different parts (so you'll need PS 2015 at least). You can then either export them seperatly using the artboard export of everything in one big file (using the old safe for web).

The color part puts a strong focus on accessibility.

Please feel free to fork, enhance it, use it and send feedbacks :)
